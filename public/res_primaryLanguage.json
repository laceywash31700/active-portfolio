    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lacey Washington, My journey into software development started out of necessity â€“ I needed to support my mom and break free from a tough financial spot. Fueled by sheer determination, I jumped into coding through a software development program, thanks to a full-ride scholarship. Navigating algorithms and solving problems creatively quickly turned into passion of mine â€“ it's been a mix of fun and frustration, but I wouldn't have it any other way. My former job as a pharmacy tech injected some customer service skills and empathy into my toolkit, making my soft-skills even stronger for my future tech career, turning me into a problem-solving ninja with some adaptability and quick learning on the side.  I began to enjoy using tech to make life better for everyone, no matter what they're dealing with. Iâ€™m the top problem solver you've been waiting for, ready to bring my unique mix of skills to the table so, Let's make a difference together. If you think I can make a good addtion to your team please take a look at my resume on either linkedIn or github to contact me. Thanks!ðŸ˜Ž",

In collaboration with two other classmates. We used a PostgreSQL database, juggling an extensive data model with out-of-the-box user authentication. My job was mostly Integrating testing using Jest  and getting the site up for deployment. So far the site is still being developed for more features by me in the coming future",
